IBM HR Employee Attrition Analysis – Insight Summary
====================================================

This analysis investigates attrition patterns in IBM's workforce using visual dashboards. 
The dataset contains employee information such as job role, salary, age, department, and satisfaction metrics. 
Below is a summary of the insights uncovered through the app’s visualizations and data analysis:

1. Attrition Overview
----------------------

Overall Attrition:
- Count Analysis shows that the majority of employees have not left the organization.
- A significant minority did leave, indicating areas for possible intervention.

Attrition by Department:
- Sales Department had the highest count of attrition.
- Research & Development has more employees but a relatively lower attrition rate.
- Human Resources shows a relatively higher proportion of attrition, though the department size is smaller.

Attrition by Gender:
- Males and females both experience attrition.
- Slightly more males have left compared to females in absolute terms.

Attrition by Job Role:
- Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians experience the highest attrition.
- Manufacturing Directors and Research Directors have the lowest attrition, suggesting more job stability.

Age Distribution with Attrition:
- Younger employees (30-35 years) show higher attrition.
- Attrition decreases with increasing age, indicating longer retention in older employees.

2. Training & Development
--------------------------

Training Times vs Attrition:
- Employees who left the company typically received less training in the last year.
- This suggests training opportunities could help improve retention.

Training by Department:
- Training hours are fairly evenly distributed across departments.
- R&D appears to receive slightly more training, followed by HR and Sales.

3. Compensation Analysis
-------------------------

Monthly Income vs Attrition:
- Employees who left generally had lower monthly incomes.
- This indicates that higher pay correlates with better retention.

Monthly Income by Department:
- R&D employees earn more on average than other departments.
- Sales has a wider income spread, suggesting compensation variability.

Percent Salary Hike vs Attrition:
- Surprisingly, attrition is not significantly lower among employees with higher salary hikes.
- Raises alone may not be a strong retention factor.

4. Job Satisfaction & Work-Life Balance
----------------------------------------

Across all satisfaction metrics:
- Employees with lower scores in Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance are more likely to leave.
- Higher satisfaction scores correlate with lower attrition.

Key Satisfaction Metrics:
- Job Satisfaction: Lower among those who left.
- Environment Satisfaction: Dissatisfaction linked with attrition.
- Work-Life Balance: Better balance helps retention.
- Relationship Satisfaction: Poor relationships with colleagues/supervisors may influence departure.

5. Key Drivers of Attrition (Random Forest Model)
--------------------------------------------------

I used machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) was used to identify key features influencing attrition.

Top 10 Features Influencing Attrition:

| Rank | Feature                    | Importance Score |
|------|----------------------------|------------------|
| 1    | Monthly Income             | 0.0805           |
| 2    | Age                        | 0.0635           |
| 3    | Daily Rate                 | 0.0574           |
| 4    | OverTime                   | 0.0557           |
| 5    | Total Working Years        | 0.0539           |
| 6    | Monthly Rate               | 0.0513           |
| 7    | Hourly Rate                | 0.0502           |
