    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Departmental Risk**: Sales and Research & Development departments experience the highest attrition.\n",
    "- **Demographics**: Younger employees and those with fewer years at the company are more prone to leaving.\n",
    "- **Training Gaps**: Employees who receive less training are more likely to leave.\n",
    "- **Compensation Disparities**: Lower monthly income and minimal salary hikes contribute to attrition.\n",
    "- **Work Conditions**: Overtime and poor satisfaction scores are significant red flags.\n",
    "- **Top Attrition Drivers**: OverTime, Age, MonthlyIncome, JobRole, JobInvolvement, and EnvironmentSatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Training Programs**: Increase access to regular and relevant training sessions.\n",
    "2. **Salary Review and Optimization**: Reassess income structures and align with industry standards.\n",
    "3. **Employee Satisfaction Audits**: Conduct periodic reviews of job satisfaction, work-life balance, and environment.\n",
    "4. **Focus on Critical Roles**: Special retention efforts for high-turnover departments and roles.\n",
    "5. **Utilize Predictive Modeling**: Deploy attrition prediction tools to preemptively identify at-risk employees.\n",
